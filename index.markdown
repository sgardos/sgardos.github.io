## Snapshot in My Memory

This is one of my favortie songs I have ever covered! It is about saying goodbye to someone you love, and wishing you had savored that last moment of farewell a little bit more.

## The Lonely Acorn - A Stop-Frame Animation

This is a stop-frame animation I made with two of my friends. We spent weeks making the sets, and carefully shooting each scene. By the end of the process we had thousands of pictures, we were well worn out, but we all agreed that the hard work made the experience all the more gratifying. To this day this project is one of my favorite projects I have ever worked. Our project ended up placing first at the statewide Technological Student's Association competition.
